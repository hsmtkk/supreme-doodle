 Men sleep better than women study finds. This is breakingnewsinglish.com. A new study has discovered that men may sleep better than women. Researchers say that because of this, sleep disorders experienced by the sexes need to be treated differently. In Somnia is about 1.5 times more common among women than men. The researchers say that one reason for this is our circadian rhythms, our body clock. Women's circadian cycles are about six minutes shorter than men's. This means women physically have less time in which to rest. Another reason is motherhood, which places unequal strains and burdens on mothers. Dr. Alaina Tiani said, it's almost like their brain was half-listening out for their children in the middle of the night, in case they needed something. People worldwide are finding it increasingly harder to get a good night's rest. The stress and pressures of day-to-day life mean more of us are struggling to get 40 winks. It is estimated that around 30% of the global population is experiencing sleep deprivation. This is having adverse effects on our health. A lack of sleep can lead to detrimental and often life-threatening health conditions. These include diabetes, heart disease and hypertension. In sufficient sleep can also negatively impact our powers to concentrate and lead to a deterioration in mental health. Neurologist Dr. Eric Sklar said, there is a high correlation with underlying psychiatric disorders and insomnia.
